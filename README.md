# Project---Escape-The-Puzzle
Escape The Puzzle - This is a simple text based puzzle game made for a MATLAB mid semester project.

- To play the game, run EscapeThePuzzle_FinalDraft.m
- The rest of the files are audio/images or functions essential for the running of the game.

I'm very thrilled to present Escape the Puzzle, my first ever attempt at coding a game. 
It combines some of my love for storytelling along with some simple puzzles doable with what I have learnt so far in coding.
The code uses basic input/output, loops, arrays, conditional execution and functions along with heaps of commenting so you can understand what each part of the code does.
I had heaps of fun making this game and I hope you enjoy playing it too.

Thank you for checking out my project!
